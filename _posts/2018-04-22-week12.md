### Group Progress
My [pull request](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9209) has been closed and was called "hacky". Honestly I probably could have solved 
the issue differently but I wanted to at least submit a change and get some input from the community. I wasn't sure why the changes I was making
to the code did not affect it the way that I wanted it to and after reading that my work was hacky I felt discouraged.
