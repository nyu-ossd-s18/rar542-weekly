###Humanitarian Open Source Projects

Honestly, I don't use many open source projects, but I'd consider Mozilla a group with projects that have humanitarian aspects. While it's not as
noble as other projects, Firefox  has aspects that definitely try to improve the lives of its users. With increased security and adblockers,
Firefox attempts to make browsing the web safer and more secure for everyone who uses it as their primary browser. 

Likewise, many open source projects have small humanitarian aspects. Note editors like Atom allow users to add different plugins that might make 
the users experience using it better. To me, while they're not typical humanitarian projects, these open source projects still find a small 
place in the definition provided.
