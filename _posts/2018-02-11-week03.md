I selected this article because I have a strong appreciation for Nintendo and all of their games. Honestly, I didn't think I knew enough
about any particular subject so I decided to make a small edit to something I cared about. The contribution was a simple addition to a
sentence, explaining that the original Super Mario Bros. was released for not only the NES but the Famicom Disk System as well. This 
was soon reverted because "the NES is an American version of the Famicom." I haven't found another article to contribute to but I will
continue to look for more!

Surprisingly enough, even this small and short lived contribution was actually really fulfilling and I can proudly say I've edited a Wikipedia page (even though the edit
itself was nothing substantial).
