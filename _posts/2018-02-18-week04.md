### Pull Request:
The issue I claimed involved a formatting issue. I have fixed the error and issued a pull request.

### Code Triage:
I signed up for the following projects:
1. youtube-dl
2. docker
3. vscode

I looked at [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/39236) issue from vscode, which was opened a little more than 3 months ago,
but seems to have gone stale. The last response was around 2 and a half months ago, where a contributor assigned the program manager the 
issue. There have been no further updates, probably because the issue was a feature request that they did not feel a need to implement.

I also looked at [this](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/21469) issue from docker, which was opened about 2 years ago to discuss how to better integrate docker-storage-setup with docker. The 
conversation in this thread was pretty full, with a decent amount of back and forth, but died down, which is evident by the last response 
being about a year and a half ago.
