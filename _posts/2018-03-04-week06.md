### Team Assessment and Plan

#### Strengths and Weaknesses of Our Team
Many of us have experience with Javascript, HTML, and CSS because of AIT. We also know Python to some extent.

Our biggest weakness is our collective lack of experience in contributing to large open source projects. Coming up with contributions that we can make and navigating through the logistics of contributing may prove to be a daunting task at first but I believe this weakness will dissipate with time and experience.

#### Our Meeting Times
Wednesdays?

#### Milestones
To be determined.

### Which Open Data Week Events I Plan on Attending
I plan on going to NYC Open Data Week @ NYU and myPB.community Launch Event.

### My Contributions Made this Week
