###Questions for Danna

Do you think it can be said that either purely open source or closed source projects work better over the other? Can one produce better 
results?

What is your stance on open source? Should all companies be 100% open?

Is there something at Google that is closed source that you think would benefit from being open source?

###Group Progress

We chose and claimed an issue to work on. We each replicated the issue and attempted to determine where the issue was being affected
in code. We realized that the issue isn't that the information isn't being saved, but isn't correctly being sent. 

I looked into the code myself and tried to find out where exactly the fix might be located. I also had to fix up my dev environment a bit.
